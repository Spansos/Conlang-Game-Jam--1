# follow these steps if you or a loved one wants to compile this themself

**requires a c++ compiler**, get one from interwebs if not have

download the library sfml from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/. and put the .a's in lib. (probably also put .dlls in bin)
the makefile should be able to compile the program without too much hassle (assuming you have set up your compiler and such exactly 1-to-1 to mine (no i will not explain how i have mine set up))

if it doesn't compile then do one of the following steps, depending on how much effort you're willing to put in:
1. weep
2. idk, reverse-engineer the makefile or something
